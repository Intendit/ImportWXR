ImportWXR extension
===================

This Bolt Extension is an Import filter for WXR / XML files, as created by
Wordpress or PivotX.

How to use this extension, in a few simple steps:

 1. Acquire a `.wxr file`, and place it in the folder `app/config/extensions/importwxr`.
 2. In the Bolt backend, go to 'Import WXR'.
 3. Follow the steps on screen.
 4. Tweak the configuration file, if needed. It can be found at
    `app/config/extensions/importwxr.bolt.yml`, or using the 'Configure Extensions'
    option in the backend of Bolt.
 5. Repeat until satisfied with the results.

Note: After importing, scroll down to check if the script completed. If
categories were found in the `.wxr`-file, the script will tell you which should
be added to your `taxonomy.yml`-file.

If you're importing a `.wxr` file that was generated by a recent version of
Wordpress, the 'mapping' as defined in the `importwxr.bolt.yml`configuration
should be good as-is. You might need to make a few modifications to your
`contenttypes.yml`, to make sure all fields are present. See the example below,
for a working example.

If you already have set up your own contenttypes, just make sure of the following:

 - The fields `teaser` and `body` need to be present in your `pages` and
   `entries` contenttypes.
 - Make sure the `taxonomy` is present, otherwise the extension will not import
   your existing categories and tags.
 - Add the `attachments` contenttype, if you want to import the attachments from
   Wordpress.

Note: Subsequent runs of the extension will keep importing the found
posts/entries again and again. If you're working on a fresh Bolt database, it's
probably good to set `post_id: id` in the mapping configuration. This will make
the importer use the original ID from the import file, and it will overwrite
them, preventing duplicates in the Bolt database.
